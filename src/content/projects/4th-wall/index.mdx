<Section title="Description">

Designed for the Plaza cinema, it features modular wooden cubes, each containing small openings that reveal film excerpts on embedded screens. The installation encourages visitors to explore the space and peek at the selected scenes focused on introspective moments, where characters are immersed in thought. However, when a viewer comes too close, the characters acknowledge their presence—pausing their actions and staring directly at the spectator. The result is a disturbing experience that blurs the line between observer and observed, questioning our voyeuristic relationship with on-screen narratives.
