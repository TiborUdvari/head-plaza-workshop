<Section title="Description">

Cameras in filmmaking are more than just recording devices—
they are storytelling tools that shape what audiences focus on.
This installation allows audiences to step into the role of the
cameraman by exploring classic movie clips demonstrating each
technique. By physically playing with the camera, they can simulate
professional cinematographic effects. Their real-time footage
is displayed alongside the original movie clip, offering a direct
visual comparison and a deeper understanding of the techniques.

As an engaging and educational experience, ‘Action!’ makes the
production part of cinema accessible to a general audience. Audiences
not only gain insight into the technical aspects of filmmaking
but also leave with their own recorded movie clips, allowing
them to share their creations and continue the conversation
beyond the exhibition space.
