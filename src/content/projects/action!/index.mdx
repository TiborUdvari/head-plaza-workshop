    ‘Action!’ is an interactive installation that immerses visitors in a
    hands-on experience of camera movements in cinema. The setup features
    multiple behind-the-scene filming studios, each showcasing a cinematic
    technique such as Dolly Zoom, Arc Shot, Zero-Gravity Shot and Mirror Shot.

<Section title="Description">

Cameras in filmmaking are more than just recording devices—
they are storytelling tools that shape what audiences focus on.
This installation allows audiences to step into the role of the
cameraman by exploring classic movie clips demonstrating each
technique. By physically playing with the camera, they can simulate
professional cinematographic effects. Their real-time footage
is displayed alongside the original movie clip, offering a direct
visual comparison and a deeper understanding of the techniques.

As an engaging and educational experience, ‘Action!’ makes the
production part of cinema accessible to a general audience. Audiences
not only gain insight into the technical aspects of filmmaking
but also leave with their own recorded movie clips, allowing
them to share their creations and continue the conversation
beyond the exhibition space.

<BigText>Camera is a storyteller</BigText>

Our project is rooted in the fundamental role of the camera in shaping cinematic storytelling. Unlike theater, where the audience has a fixed perspective, cinema actively directs the viewer’s attention through camera movement, framing, and shot composition. The camera is not just a recording device but an active storyteller, influencing how the audience perceives and engages with a scene.

<Section title="Field Observations">

<BigText>Camera movement techniques</BigText>

To develop our concept, we conducted field research, including surveys with both film professionals and general audiences. We explored their understanding of cinematic techniques and how they impact storytelling. Professionals emphasized how camera movements create emotional depth and narrative rhythm, while general audiences often appreciated these techniques unconsciously but lacked awareness of their mechanics.

This research confirmed our project’s necessity:
an interactive experience that makes cinematic techniques tangible for both enthusiasts and newcomers. By allowing users to physically recreate iconic shots, we bridge the gap between passive viewing and active cinematic engagement.

<Section title="Visual Moodboard">
  Just like how Steven Spielberg filmed with toy trains in The Fabelmans, we
  wanted to create a miniature amusement park-like experience where each small
  film studio represents a different camera technique. This setup allows people
  to have fun while easily moving the camera to shoot their own films. The final
  installation design includes various ideas—it could be as simple as a table
  setup or arranged as separate studio “islands” positioned in different
  locations.

<Section title="Shape Research">

To recreate the authentic feel of original films, we conducted several tests using a 3D printer to build film studios as accurately as possible. The ideal film studio consists of a 3D-printed model with a camera track installed near the main subject, allowing users to replicate the intended camera technique as closely as possible.

<Section title="Paper Prototype">

We built a camera track using cardboard boxes, set up a film set with 3D-printed objects and figurines, and tested the setup using a smartphone camera.

<Section title="Experiments">
  To accurately replicate real filmmaking techniques, we used figurines and
  various objects to shoot scenes using dolly zoom, tilt shot, and arc shot.
  Additionally, to implement the dolly zoom effect, we created a webpage that
  detects faces and automatically zooms in on the screen, allowing us to test
  the effect interactively.
