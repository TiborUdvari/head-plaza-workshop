    Plaza Video Club offers a fresh way to rediscover film
selection in an era dominated by streaming platforms
and declining cinema attendance. Inspired by the gol-
den age of video rental stores, it bridges digital conve-
nience with the personal touch of curated recommenda-
tions.


Much like the conversations with a store clerk that often
led to unexpected discoveries, this experience revives
that sense of serendipity. Rather than prioritizing
blockbusters, it serves as a reference tool, guiding users
toward independent, lesser-known, and overlooked
films.

<Section title="Description">
Our project is inspired by the rental boxes of the 2000s, where
film discovery was personal and tactile. Like those boxes, we
aim to offer curated, lesser-known films, in a space where
personal exploration and serendipity take center stage.
The object remains simple, while still reclaiming visual
elements from cinemasâ€” curtains, cameras, video clubs...
Its simplicity leaves space for users to personalize this
installation to best fit their own spaces, cinemas, or brand.
