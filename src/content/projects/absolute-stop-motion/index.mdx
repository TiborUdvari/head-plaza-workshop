<Section title="Field Observations">

We explored the history and evolution of cinema, drawn in particular to the DIY spirit behind filmmaking. This fascination led us to delve into stop motion, a technique rich in creativity and practical effects, where handcrafted artistry brings stunning visuals to life.

Our initial attempts—applying AI to photos of stop-motion elements—didn't quite meet our expectations. The goal was to elevate stop motion by enhancing its visuals with AI-generated upgrades. As the idea evolved, we shifted our focus to augmented reality, drawing major inspiration from the iconic holographic board game scene in *Star Wars: A New Hope*!
